/**
 * \page mmap_main Memory Mapped Files
 * Pedigree supports memory mapped files to allow mapping File objects into
 * the address space.
 *
 * \section mmap_overview Overview
 * Pedigree's memory mapped file support includes support for both anonymous and
 * proper file-backed mappings. An anonymous mapping is one that only backs onto
 * memory (there is no file behind it). A file-backed mapping backs onto a file
 * and demand-maps it as necessary.
 *
 * File memory maps can be mapped shared or copy-on-write. Shared maps allow
 * writes directly to the file in memory (and need to be synced to appear on
 * disk). Copy-on-write maps never affect the file.
 *
 * \section mmap_vfs VFS Requirements
 * Memory mapped files do not work out-of-the-box with every filesystem. In
 * particular, filesystems that cannot guarantee page-aligned (and page-size)
 * blocks returned from File::readBlock will not work immediately.
 *
 * The basic requirements for a memory mapped file to work correctly are:
 * - File::read must be able to accept a NULL buffer, which will prime
 *     File::readBlock, rather than read into a buffer.
 * - File::readBlock must return a page-aligned, page-size block.
 * - File::pinBlock must be able to pin a block so it cannot be freed.
 * - File::unpinBlock must be able to unpin a block so it can be freed.
 *
 * Optionally, the following can be provided to enable extra functionality:
 * - File::sync(size_t, bool) which syncs a block back to disk (or some other
 *     backing store, if the File is not backed by disk).
 * - File::writeBlock which triggers a write of a block back to disk (or some
 *     other backing store).
 *
 * \section mmap_trap Trap Handling
 * At first, no mappings for the file exist in the address space. When a process
 * attempts to access a mapping, a page fault is triggered which is handled by
 * MemoryMapManager::trap.
 *
 * For anonymous memory maps, reads get mapped to a single zero page. This
 * means anonymous memory maps that have not been written to use minimal amounts
 * of memory. When an anonymous memory map is written to, a new page is mapped
 * and zeroed.
 *
 * For file memory maps, reads get mapped to the physical page for the virtual
 * page returned by File::readBlock. It is for this reason that File::pinBlock
 * is necessary -- the physical page cannot disappear underneath the file, as
 * this would cause the mapping's contents to change (and leak data from other
 * processes).
 *
 * A file memory map that is mapped shared will allow this physical page to be
 * modified on write. A copy-on-write file memory map will trigger a copy of the
 * page, and further writes will go to the copy of this page.
