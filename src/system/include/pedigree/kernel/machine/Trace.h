/**
 * TRACE provides an interface to tracing kernel startup progress.
 *
 * In release builds, tracing should be disabled to avoid the performance hit.
 *
 * Think of TRACE as a direct path to push messages to a debug log or other
 * target, which may or may not be interspersed with actual kernel log messages.
 *
 * Note: this must be completely functional even before constructors have run
 * as it cannot be guaranteed that tracing will not be needed before
 * constructors have been invoked. This differs to the kernel log, which
 * requires constructors to be run to be useful.
