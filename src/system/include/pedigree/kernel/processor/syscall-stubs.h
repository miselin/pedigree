#ifndef SYSCALL_STUBS_H

/**
 * \module syscall_stubs Syscall Stubs
 * This provides the main entry point for all syscall definitions. The header
 * exports the syscallN() functions for the target architecture automatically.
 *
 * You will need to define SERVICE, SERVICE_ERROR, and SERVICE_INIT to make use
 * of this header.
 *
 * SERVICE is the syscall service identifier, as per those in the Syscall_t
 * enum.
 *
 * SERVICE_INIT creates any locals that are needed for e.g. error handling.
 *
 * SERVICE_ERROR is the variable into which the syscall's error status will be
 * stored; it must work as a single register on the target system.
 *
 * You cannot mix syscall services in the same compilation unit.
