/**
 * \brief Utility class to provide a ring buffer.
 *
 * Using this class provides safety in accessing the ring buffer as well as
 * the ability to check (with and without blocking) whether the buffer can
 * be read or written to at this time.
 *
 * The idea of the waitFor function is to provide a way for applications
 * desiring integration with a select()-style interface to block until the
 * condition is met.
