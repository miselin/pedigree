/**
 * ProducerConsumer provides a very light abstraction for a work queue.
 *
 * Producer(s) push tasks into the queue by calling produce(). All of these
 * work items are fire-and-forget - there is no way for callers to collect a
 * return status or any other kind of information about the completion of a
 * task. If this is important, a RequestQueue is a better choice.
 *
 * The consumer, which inherits from ProducerConsumer, implements consume().
 * As tasks are produced, consume() is called for each task, one at a time.
 *
 * In single-threaded environments, produce() just calls consume().
