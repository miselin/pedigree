# musl syscall implementation

The amd64 expansion backlog starts at `0867c8927`: 108 untranslated syscall
numbers referenced by the bundled musl source plus five mapped operations with
no successful valid implementation. The [inventory](musl-syscall-implementation.csv)
tracks all 113. A mapping alone does not close an item; its scope and public musl
contract evidence must be recorded.

Work proceeds by families, starting with IPC, then timers and signal integration,
VM and descriptor-backed objects, file operations, and process/resource features.
Simple queries and aliases follow the larger ownership and blocking contracts.
Linux administration and isolation remain explicit work items; an error-only
placeholder or unconditional success is not implementation evidence.

Each completed pass receives a local commit. Queue, timer, and process-interface
state belongs in POSIX. Shared kernel/VFS changes should express a reusable
lifetime or behavior contract that cannot be implemented correctly inside the
subsystem. Public-wrapper guest tests use fresh headless images, disposable
disks, per-suite exit statuses, and one/four-CPU runs for concurrent behavior.

## IPC pass

Implemented and guest-verified: System V shared memory, semaphore sets, message
queues, and POSIX message queues (18 numbers; 95 backlog items remain). Coverage includes creation/lookup permissions,
fork/exit lifetime, removal while referenced or blocked, bounded resources,
interruptible waits, ABI marshalling, and message selection/priority semantics.
POSIX queue notification includes musl's SIGEV_THREAD cookie transport.

The guest application is `ipc-contract-test`; optional arguments select
`messages`, `semaphores`, `mqueues`, or `shared-memory`. Each family runs in a
bounded child and reports its own result. The integration run also exercises the
existing signal/exec, user-copy, futex, descriptor-passing, readiness, and resource
contracts.

The implementation uses finite resources and reports exhaustion. Defaults and
limits are exposed through the corresponding IPC control queries where the ABI
provides them:

- SysV messages: 128 queues; 8192-byte messages; 16384-byte default queue storage,
  configurable up to 65536 bytes with privilege for increases.
- SysV semaphores: 128 sets, 256 semaphores per set, 128 operations per atomic
  vector, and 4096 undo records. Waiters use broadcast/recheck; strict FIFO
  handoff is not promised.
- SysV shared memory: 128 segments, 16 MiB per segment, 64 MiB total, and 128
  explicit attachments per process. HugeTLB is unsupported. SHM_LOCK pins pages;
  per-user RLIMIT_MEMLOCK accounting remains part of the resource/VM expansion.
- POSIX queues: 64 live queues, up to 128 messages of 8192 bytes per queue. The
  AF_NETLINK endpoint implements the notification cookie transport required by
  musl; general routing netlink remains outside this IPC interface.

Realtime signal numbers above 34 remain dependent on the next signal expansion.
This bounds current SIGEV_SIGNAL choices without blocking the tested musl
SIGEV_THREAD notification path.

Verification: the native routing/ABI checks passed 42 tests. Fresh, display-free
QEMU guests with one and four CPUs passed all four IPC families plus 12 existing
regression suites, including per-suite zero exit statuses and the final marker.
Logs and the disposable-image harness are under
`/private/tmp/pedigree-musl-expansion-20260905/` (`ipc-runtime-*`). This is guest
behavioral evidence; no persistence claim is made with disk writes disabled.

Concurrent fork/exit exposed an unrelated procfs shadow-tree race. Removing the
unused PID index lets the existing VFS directory synchronization own publication;
inode allocation is now atomic. The original failure and the subsequent passing
run are retained alongside the IPC notification cleanup regression evidence.

The existing intermittent VM split/unmap investigation remains recorded
separately. Reusing the established shared-file mapping path does not establish
that the earlier fault is resolved.
